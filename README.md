# TheCrossmager
A personal fork/redesign of The Animator mod by EatYourBeets for Slay the Spire based on the affinity branch. 

# Main features:

>Hundreds of cards!

>Start as one of a large repetoir of anime series, each with a focused theme, and build a starting deck where you can customize your strikes and defends and starting cards into loadouts!

>Every card has a quote, including basics, statuses, and curses, and just about every named card has a soundbite when played or viewed in the card library, stored runs, etc.

>Start with the **Crossmager's Die**- a relic that allows you to reroll card unlocks for cards in your starting series whenever you defeat an Elite or Boss!  This replaces the other starting relics from the original mod.

>Just about every card redesigned from the original.  Cards are generally simpler in effect with powerful upgrades and focus on fun over pure balance.

>10 **Affinities**, each based on a different color: Red, Green, Blue, White, Black, Yellow, Pink, Violet, Brown, and Teal!  **Seal** cards by right clicking on them to build up stats for an affinity, then consume those stats by playing cards that scale to those affinity to boost your damage and block!

>**PokÃ©mon** are special Basic cards that can evolve into more expensive but powerful forms every time you end an act with at least 4 starting energy - these replace the Improved Strikes and Defends and you can start with them in a loadout.

>Many cards have **Special Actions** that allow you to transform them into a completely different cards, obtain special cards, and more when you meet their criteria.  This can be accessed at the campfire.

>Note: no support for building a card pool out of series nor Act 5.  The larger card pool helps to compensate for how powerful many of the cards can be.
